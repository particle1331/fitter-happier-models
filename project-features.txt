- version controlled with git
- automatic builds with GitHub actions with push and PR
- automatic deployment to gh-pages
- diff tracking between builds (uploaded _build directory)
- uses automation tools tox, makefiles
- issue: note that GitHub runner makes the build, so we won't be 
  able to see diffs between each builds (e.g. different runners).
  solution is to just monitor diffs in the code base and trust
  that the deployed page is faithful to the codebase.
