- version controlled with git
- automatic builds with GitHub actions with push and PR
- automatic deployment to gh-pages
- uses automation tools tox, makefiles
- issue: note that GitHub runner makes the build, so we won't be 
  able to see diffs between each builds. Runners make fresh build
  each time. "solution" is to just monitor diffs in the code base 
  and trust that the deployed page is faithful to the codebase.
