- version controlled with git
- automatic builds with GitHub actions with push and PR
- automatic deployment to gh-pages
- diff tracking between builds (uploaded _build directory)
- uses automation tools tox, makefiles
- note that GitHub runner makes the build, so we won't be able
  to see diffs with builds (e.g. different metadata) if we don't
  persist the build made by the runner.

  solution: add commit step to runner so it also persists the
  build made in the actions pipeline.
