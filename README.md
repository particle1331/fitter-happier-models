> Expeditions through the mountains of machine learning theory and engineering.

This is a collection of notebooks that run end-to-end after some minimal initial setup: setting up the correct directory structure, and downloading the required datasets. The datasets used are either from Kaggle or available as part of open-source libraries. Each notebook is more or less self-contained and contains roughly a book chapter's worth of information on a particular topic.
