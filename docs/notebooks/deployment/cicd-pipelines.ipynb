    "In this section, we will develop a CI/CD pipeline for our model package and prediction serving API. CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous deployment. This involves automatic testing for changes that are being merged to the main or master branch of the code repository, as well as automatically building and deploying the model package and the associated API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automation means that no person needs to run a script or SSH into a machine every time a change is made to the code base, which can be time consuming and error prone. Moreover, having a CI/CD pipeline means that the system is always in a releasable state so that development teams can quickly react to issues in production. \n",
    "Hence, a project that has a CI/CD pipeline can have faster release cycles with changes to the code deployed on a regular basis, e.g. days instead of months. This reduces the chance of breaking things and makes it easier to integrate our piece of software to the system as changes around the model are also small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, CI/CD platforms can add visibility to the release cycles which can be important when performing audits. For our project, we will be using the [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) platform which has a free tier. And we will upload our model package to [Gemfury](https://gemfury.com/) which is a private package index."
