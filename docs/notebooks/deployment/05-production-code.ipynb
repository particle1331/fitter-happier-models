    "So basically, there are three ways that we broadly speaking use to determine how to create the structure for the production code.\n",

    "### Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "So conventions are things that you don't have to do.\n",
    "You're not going to get something like a Python syntax error if you don't do it.\n",
    "But projects tend to adhere to some sort of convention in a particular area.\n",

    "This provides loads of guidelines on how to write Python code.\n",
    "Similar to that, we add a few linting tools into our project a bit later in the section.\n",
    "Those will also be opinionated and want you to adhere to certain conventions.\n",

    "### Mandatory files\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we have things that once we've made a certain decision, we then have to do so.\n",
    "We've made the decision to package our model into a Python package once we've made that decision. Then, there are certain files that are required in order to do that, like the `setup.py` file and the `MANIFEST.in` file.\n",
    "You have to have these files in order to publish a Python package, so certain decisions basically get made for us in terms of the structure and the files we need.\n",
    "Again, broadly speaking, packaging is a really easy way for us to embed our model as a dependency in an application that runs.\n",
    "There are other ways that you can persist and share your models.\n",
    "But a Python package is a nice, easy way for us.\n",
    "To do this makes it easy to version, makes it really easy to install into our consuming application."

    "\n",

    "For testing, you want to think about, can you write a single unit test for one specific bit\n",
    "of functionality?\n",
    "The most extreme case of this production code would be that we put almost everything in a single file, right?\n",
    "Now, I think everybody intuitively knows that that would be messy and hard to maintain.\n",
    "But you then continue that thread and keep following it.\n",
    "And what you start to arrive at is this idea of separation of concerns, tests, ability.\n",
    "For example, if we look at the `data_manager.py`,\n",
    "we have a function for saving the pipeline and we have a function for removing old pipelines.\n",
    "Now these could be one single function. But we choose not to have them as one function because now in a unit test, we can test removing old\n",
    "pipelines as well as saving any pipeline. This makes testing a specific discrete unit of functionality a lot easier."

    "This leads to separation\n",
    "of concerns, which leads to modularity.\n",
    "And as the name implies, separation of concerns is about designing software systems so that different\n",
    "areas of functionality are separated.\n",
    "For example, this is why we have different modules for the `data_manager.py` module, which deals with loading the training data, and then we have the validation module in `validation.py`,\n",
    "which deals with testing that our inputs to the model are correct.\n",
    "Now you could easily have these in the same module, but we choose to separate them because they're doing different things. And again, that links to testability. This is related to the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) where the first stands for single responsibility which again means that \n",
    "a class or module should have one job. Here we have `predict.py` only dealing with prediction and `train_pipeline.py` dealing with training models.\n",
    "This is just engineering good practice that links to maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to modify this package, you're going to create a pull request.\n",
    "And if you're the person reviewing this pull request and everything is all in one file, it's really difficult for you to track what's changed and understand exactly what you need to be reviewing. On the other hand, if the change is made in just a single small module, which only has code related to one area in it, it's way easier for you to immediately get the context, follow the flow of the\n",
    "program and review that pull request.\n",
    "So, this is the long term health of your code and making it nice and easy for maintainers.\n",
    "You can apply similar thought processes when you're deciding how to structure your own projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another best practice related to maintainability is optimizing for readability. \n",
    "The [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) is one that is very useful.\n",
    "You go into the code base, you look at the directories and the principle of least astonishment applies to a lot to naming. Do modules do what you expect them to do when you read the names and the same for classes and functions?\n",
    "A good way to think about this is to imagine that the person who's going to maintain your code after you is a psychopath who knows where you live.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Follow a standard where possible (PEP 8), pick a linting tool and then stick with it.\n",
    "In our case, publishing models as packages gives us a nice structure to work with. This is a recommended starting point until you get to some more complex applications where publishing as a package may not be possible. At that point, it might be time to find a new standard.\n",
    "Established conventions usually adhere to good practices, but not always.\n",
    "And learning when an established convention actually isn't the right choice for you takes a lot of time and practice. But that's something to work towards.\n",

    "So we're not allowing any minor version increases here.\n",

    "A more likely scenario is that we neglect to include a version, and if there is no version specified,\n",
    "PIP is just going to assume you want the latest version of a particular dependency.\n",
    "And it may well be that that version has progressed and it's released new features, a new major version\n",
    "perhaps, and it's got breaking changes in the API.\n",
