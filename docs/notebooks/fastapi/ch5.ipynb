    "A **dependency** is a way to wrap some logic that will retrieve some subvalues or instantiate subobjects, make something with them, and finally return a value that will be injected into the endpoint calling it. The responsibility of developers is then to only provide a declaration of how an object should be created, and let the system resolve all the dependency chains and create the actual objects at runtime."

Finally, in the case of FastAPI, it's used to generate the OpenAPI schema so that the automatic documentation can clearly show which parameters are expected for this endpoint."
