Several models can be trained on the training set whose predict probabilities can be used as feature for a further metamodel called a **stacker**. Observe that this process can be iterated to several more levels. To avoid creating meta features that are overfitted to the train set, the meta features are generated by out-of-fold (OOF) training and prediction of the models on the features of the previous level. This requires defining cross-validation folds. The same cross-validation folds will be used to generate metafeatures at deeper levels.

Indeed, the same is recommended by GM Abishek Thakur in his book [AAAMLP](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost/blob/master/AAAMLP.pdf). The following theoretical example shows that overfitting, when using different folds, can happen due to the second stage model taking advantage of a certain relationship between ground truth and first stage predictions, without this structure generalizing well to the test set.\n","\n","Consider a dataset $\\{(x_1, t_1), (x_2, t_2) \\ldots, (x_{10}, t_{10})\\}$ with five folds such that the first fold is $F_1 = (x_1, x_2)$. Let $x_1 {\\mapsto} y_1$ and $x_2 \\mapsto y_2$ where the mapping is trained on $F_{\\neg 1} = (x_3, \\ldots, x_{10}).$ We can think of modelling on $F_{\\neg 1}$ as defining some rule or distribution that the points in $F_1$ are compared against. Suppose we reshuffle folds in the next level such that the first fold is $G_1 = (y_1, y_{10}).$ Then, the model trained on $G_{\\neg 1} = (y_2, \\ldots y_9)$  overfits slightly since $y_2$ is modelled using the ground truths $(x_3, t_3), \\ldots, (x_{9}, t_9).$ This doesn't happen if we have kept the same cross-validation folds. Overfitting can be observed at the fold level, by noticing that validation scores with shuffled folds are generally lower.\n","\n","Theoretically (as mentioned in the [Kaggle Guide to Model Stacking](https://datasciblog.github.io/2016/12/27/a-kagglers-guide-to-model-stacking-in-practice/)), there is always some leakage if you train a second level model on the same training set, which you used to derive the first stage predictions. This is because you used the ground truth to get those first stage predictions, and now you take those predictions as input, and try to predict the same ground truth. However, this leakage doesn't seem to be significant in practice."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## TODO\n","\n","* Parallelize stacker training [using joblib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny3O4VpACkc&ab_channel=AbhishekThakur).\n","* Modify `StackingClassifier` to keep a dictionary of model clones.
