    "In this course, we will talk about best practices and tools for putting machine learning to production. The field for this is called **MLOps**. As an example, we will look at predicting the duration of a taxi ride (e.g. with a ride-hailing app). So what are best practices for putting ML models to production?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we first look at a simplified view of the process for machine learning projects. The first stage is **design**. We think about whether machine learning is the best solution for our problem. If so, we proceed to the next stage which is **train**. Here we train and experiment with different models, and after this stage we have a model which we can use for new data. Finally, we are in the **operate** stage. Suppose that the model is now in production, e.g. in a web service through an API, and then the customer can communicate with this API to provide an approximation of the ride duration given trip data. This process is called deployment. Part of the operate stage, is monitoring whether the model is performing well, or whether it is degrading or becoming worse. \n",
