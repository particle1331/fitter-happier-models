This includes source code, environment, data, models, hyperparameters, and so on which are important for reproducing the experiment as well as for making actual predictions. \n",

As an alternative, we will experiment tracking platforms such as [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/). MLFlow has four main components: tracking, models, model registry, and projects. In this course, we only be cover the first three. \n",
