If you are likely to use statistics in your work and you are a Pythonista, familiarizing yourself with this library is a very good idea. \n",

Each observation in the series can be expressed as either a sum or a product of the components. It is worth pointing out that an alternative to using a multiplicative decomposition is to first transform the data until the variation in the series appears to be stable over time, then use an additive decomposition. This is equivalent to using an additive decomposition with log transformed components. "
