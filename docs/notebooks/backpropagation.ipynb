    "This notebook provides an introduction to neural network learning using backpropagation. We discuss backpropagation in the context of directed acyclic computational graphs. Our main result is that a single training step (consisting of both a forward and a backward pass into the network) has a time and memory complexity that is linear in the network size. In the last section, we take a closer look at the implementation of `.backward` in PyTorch."
