    "**Problem.** [[Reverse Shuffle Merge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reverse-shuffle-merge/problem) (HR)]. Given a string $S$ containing characters with even counts, we want to find a lexically minimal string $A$ containing half of each characters of $S$ such that $a_i = s_{j_i}$ where $j_{k} \\leq j_{k-1} \\leq \\ldots \\leq j_1$ with $k = \\frac{1}{2}|S|.$ For example, if $S$ is `eggcegcg` then $A$ is the string `cegg` which can be constructed as `路gg路e路c路` within $S$."

    "**Solution.** Note that we can iterate over $S$ from right to left choosing to skip or take a character. Since $A$ has to be minimal, we want to take minimal characters, and skip those that are large. However, skipping too often can also result in a suboptimal solution. Consider `S = 'cdeedcaaaa'` here skipping `c` and `d` gets us in trouble since `e` reaches its skip limit of 1/2 its count, and we are forced to take it, getting the suboptimal solution `A = 'aaedc'`. Hence, we want to take characters, unless we are forced to skip, or we have better options:"

Our sequence then becomes `a <= a <= b`. The equals is important here to allow consecutive same characters. This is also why we added `.` at the start which is smaller than any character. \n",
