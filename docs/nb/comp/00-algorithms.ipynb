    "**Problem.** [[Reverse Shuffle Merge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/reverse-shuffle-merge/problem) (HR)]. Given a string $S$ containing characters with even counts, we want to find a lexically minimal string $A$ containing half of each characters of $S$ such that $a_i = s_{j_i}$ where $j_{k} \\leq j_{k-1} \\leq \\ldots \\leq j_1$ with $k = \\frac{1}{2}|S|.$ For example, if $S$ is `eggcegcg` then $A$ is the string `cegg` which can be constructed as `路gg路e路c路` within $S$."

Consider `S = 'cdeedcaaaa'` here skipping `c` and `d` gets us in trouble since `e` reaches its skip limit of 1/2 its count, and we are forced to take it, getting the suboptimal solution `A = 'aaedc'`. Hence, we want to take characters, unless we are forced to skip, or we have better options:"
