The model only sees the train set during training. Meanwhile, the model is evaluated on the same validation set getting controlled results. Note that modifying training hyperparameters between runs means that the validation set is now being overfitted. Techniques such as [k-fold cross-validation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/) or mitigates this, but can be expensive for training large models.\n",

It is best practice that the test evaluation is done exactly once. Note that the training, validation, and test sets are chosen to be disjoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks.** Regularization tends to flatten out the classical U-shape validation curve that occurs before epoch-wise double descent ({numref}`01-double-descent-epochs`) where the model overfits. Assuming the model is sufficiently complex so that there is little bias, underfitting can indicate a problem with the optimizer (e.g. learning rate). We will see in the next chapter that training loss curves stuck to values away from zero may indicate a problem with the optimizer (stuck in a plateau, or bad local optima)."

    "**Remark.** A commonly used technique is **early stopping** which stops training once the validation curves stops improving after a set number of steps. One consequence of epoch-wise double descent is that early stopping only helps in the relatively narrow parameter regime of critically parameterized models ({numref}`01-double-descent-epochs`)! In fact, practical experience shows that early stopping results in overfitting the validation set ({numref}`01-early-stopping-bad`)."
