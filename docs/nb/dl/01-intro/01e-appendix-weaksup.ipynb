    "In this section, we apply what we learned in this chapter to implement **weak supervision**.\n",
    "The idea of weak supervision is that for each data point there is a latent true label that we do not have access to (even during training), instead we can utilize weak signals from user-defined **labeling functions** (LFs).\n",
    "\n",
    "LFs can be thought of as heuristic rules that can be applied to a large subset of the data. In case the LF is not applicable, then the function simply abstains from making a prediction. Note that this is a realistic scenario, it's easier to describe rules than to manually annotate a large number of data. LFs provides noisy, less expensive labels, which can be useful in training noise-aware discriminative models. "
