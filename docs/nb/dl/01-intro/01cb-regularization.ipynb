    "How do we control bias and variance? There are two solutions: (1) getting **more data**, (2) tuning **model complexity**. More data decreases variance but has no effect on bias. Increasing complexity decreases bias but increases variance. Since biased models do not scale well with data, a good approach is to start with a complex model and decrease complexity it until we get a good tradeoff. This approach is called **regularization**. Regularization can be thought of as a continuous knob on complexity that smoothly restricts model class."

This prevents overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons during training, which in turn limits the capacity of the model to fit noise in the training data. Since only $1 - p$ units are present during training, the activations are scaled by $\\frac{1}{1 - p}$ to match test behavior.\n",
