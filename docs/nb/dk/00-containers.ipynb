    "Docker at its core solves the problem of installing dependencies across different machines. This along with reproducibility is a central concern in deploying machine learning systems. To work with Docker, we have to understand the concepts of **images** and **containers**. Docker after all can be thought of as an entire ecosystem around creating containers from images and running containers. This notebook is adapted from the first three sections of [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/)."

Docker is able to isolate resources using namespaces and set usage and prioritization limits using control groups which are features of the Linux kernel.
