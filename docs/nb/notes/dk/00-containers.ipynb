    "Containerization solves the problem of running applications having multiple dependencies on the same machne, as well as having running applications consistently across different machines. This along with reproducibility is a central concern in deploying machine learning systems. This is done by means of **images** and **containers**. Images can be thought of as templates specifying installation steps which are built by the host machine to get actual running containers. Images can then be pushed onto a registry which other machines can pull from (e.g. during an update {numref}`docker-envs`). This ensures no configuration drift between the rebuilt containers. Finally, applications run inside isolated containers. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) provides an entire ecosystem for efficiently working with containers."
