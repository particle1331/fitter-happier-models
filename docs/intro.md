p. 41. {cite}`James2021` A comparison of the KNN decision boundaries (solid black
curves) obtained using $K = 1$ and $K = 100.$ With
$K = 1,$ the decision boundary is overly flexible, while with $K = 100$ it is not
sufficiently flexible. The Bayes decision boundary is shown as a purple dashed
line.
