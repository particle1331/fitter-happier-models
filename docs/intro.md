This is a collection of notebooks on machine learning theory and engineering. Each notebook should run end-to-end after some minimal initial setup (setting up the directory structure, downloading the datasets, and setting up the environment). The name of this collection is inspired by the following study:

learning: An experimental study in a data science competition. PLoS ONE

[Fig. 3 of the above study]. Evolution of solution discovery for members of the two groups. The efficient network converged on a small set of solutions, whereas individuals in the inefficient network explored a greater diversity of solutions, and eventually converged on the best solution.
